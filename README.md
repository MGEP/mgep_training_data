# mgep_training_data
This repository contains the data set used for artificial neutral network training, including Monte Carlo (OpenMC) high-fidelity modeling and simulation result of mit graphite exponential pile (mgep) and the corresponding experimental data signals.  
The input dimensions are the positions for two control rods (initiating control rod-ICR and responding control rod-RCR respectively).
And the output dimensions are detector signals (Helium-3 absorption rate) located at 4 different graphite channels (F, G, I and J), 
which channel is then divided into 90 equal-length meshes in high-fidelity numerical modeling, but 13 (low spatial resoltion) or 38 eqal-length meshes (high spatial resoltion) in experimental measuring.
