# mgep_simulation
This is the repo that contains the Monte Carlo (OpenMC) simulation result of mit graphite exponential pile (mgep) numerical modeling. 
The input dimensions are the positions for two control rods (initiating control rod-ICR and responding control rod-RCR respectively).
And the output dimensions are detector signals (Helium-3 absorption rate) located at 4 different graphite channels (F, G, I and J), 
each channel being divided into 90 meshes.
